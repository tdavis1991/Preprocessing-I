        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I grew up in a small town in SC, as much as I love my home town I like to get away from it from time to time. I've been passionate about the tech industry since I was young. I just find it amazing how much an impact technology has in our world. I decided I wanted to make a change in the world as well, so I signed up for a full stack web dev course @ <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School.</a>Now I am that much closer to achieving my goal. </p>
